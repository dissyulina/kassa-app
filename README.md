# kassa-app

Welcome to the Kassa App! Kassa App was made as a cashier input system used in a small business to help to input the sales, know the total order, and save the order to the database.
For now, the app is not linked to a payment system provider, and thus the cashier still has to input the total price manually to a card reader or handle the payment by cash.
